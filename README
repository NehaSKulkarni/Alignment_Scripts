The role of these scripts is to take raw RNA-Seq reads (.fastq or .fq), quality check them, remove adapter sequences and low quality base calls if necessary, then align
to a reference genome assembly (.fasta or .fa) with the aids of a genome annotation (.gtf -.gff is similar but don't use here) to produce alignment files (.bam or .sam) which
are then quantified to read counts (.txt) for use in downstream analysis in R/Python. 

It is not necessary to create output directories before running; they will be created if they don't exist.
To run on the front end use bash. To send to compute nodes use sbatch. Script inputs use relative paths, but full paths will work too obviously. 


1.Quality_check.sh - creates individual quality checks with FastQC and aggregates with MultiQC - look at fastqc.html files and multiqc_report.html for restults 
TO RUN: sbatch/bash 1.Quality_check.sh reads_directory output_directory filetype[e.g .fq.gz]

2.Trim_reads_parallel.sh / 2.Trim_reads.sh - removed adapters, trims lows quality base calls from 3' end (< PHRED 20) and runs quality check.
Trim_reads_parallel should be faster. This step is optional if quality is fine and no adapters are present. Trimmed reads will hava _val_1/_val_2 added to their filenames e.g r1 becomes r1_val_1
TO RUN: sbatch/bash 2.Trim_reads_parallel.sh reads_directory output_directory file_type[e.g .fq.gz] r1_syntax[e.g r_1] sequencing_technology[illumina or nextera].

3.Make_STAR_index.sh - creates the genome index before alignment. Only necessary to run if an index is not already created. Unless using v. short/v. long reads I recommend an overhang of 100. 
Overhang must be the same in the index and alignment steps. 
TO RUN: sbatch/bash Make_STAR_index.sh 

4.Run_alignment.sh - Aligns reads against index of genome assembly created in previous step to output BAM (alignment) files. These are large files so ensure enough space is available.
TO RUN: sbatch/bash 4.Run_alignment.sh reads_directory output_directory r1_syntax[e.g r_1_val_1] filetype[e.g .fq.gz] gtf_file STAR_genome_index_directory overhang
4.Run_alignment_multiple.sh allows more than 1 pair to be aligned if necessary i.e if sample split across multiple lanes. Extra argument is the syntax of the lane identifier e.g L001   

5.Count_alignments.sh - Outputs counts text file (not transformed or logged) from the bam files.
TO RUN: bash Count_alignments.sh bams_dir output_dir gtf_file
